### Testing Instructions

- Describe how to test the project using Parcel. Mention if any specific pages or functions need to be tested.

### Dependencies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used in this project for creating reusable UI components.

- **React DOM**: Provides DOM-specific methods for rendering React components in web browsers.

- **Parcel**: A fast, zero-configuration web application bundler. It compiles and optimizes the project's assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), handling module bundling, transpiling, and live reloading for both development and production builds.

- **@parcel/transformer-sass**: A Parcel transformer that compiles SASS/SCSS files into CSS, allowing the use of SASS in the project's stylesheets.

- **Process**: A Node.js package that provides access to environment variables and other useful global process information used throughout the project.

### Troubleshooting

- **Build Not Reflecting Updates**: Parcel aggressively caches files to speed up builds. If updates aren't being reflected, the cache might be outdated. Try clearing the Parcel cache manually using the command `rm -rf .parcel-cache` and then running `npm build`. This will force Parcel to rebuild everything from scratch and pick up your latest changes.
